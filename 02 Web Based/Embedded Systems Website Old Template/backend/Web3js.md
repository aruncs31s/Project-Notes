# Web3js Backend 
 > [!summary]- **Why**
 > -  decentralized, no passwords.
>- No need to manage sensitive user data.

> - You’ll need to implement wallet connection UI.
- Must handle backend signature verification securely.
- Limited to users who have crypto wallets.
- Managing sessions and tokens still needed (like with traditional auth).

 **"Sign in with Ethereum"** or **wallet-based authentication**. 

## ✅ What I Can Do with Web3 Authentication:

Web3 authentication allows users to:

- Log in using a ==**crypto wallet==** (e.g., MetaMask).
- Prove ownership of a wallet address by ==**signing a message**==.
- ==Interact with blockchain-based services.==

This can be integrated into **any frontend** (including Astro) using JavaScript libraries like:

- `ethers.js`
- [`wagmi`](https://wagmi.sh/) (React-based)
- [`web3modal`](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal) or [`@web3auth`](https://web3auth.io/)

## 🧩 High-Level Flow

1. **Frontend** (Astro):
	- Ask the user to connect their wallet.
	- Generate a nonce and ask them to sign it.
	- Send the wallet address and signature to your backend.
2. **Backend**:
	- Verify the signature.
	- Issue a session token (JWT or cookie-based).
	- Store user session / data.

This method is **stateless and passwordless** — no need for email/password registration.

## 🔧 Tooling Stack Suggestion

If you're using **Astro with no frontend framework**, you'll need to use plain JavaScript or Alpine.js + Web3 libraries like `ethers.js`.

If you are using **React inside Astro (via islands)**, then libraries like `wagmi` + `viem` + `Web3Modal` make things easier.

For **backend verification**, use:

- **Node.js** backend (API endpoint).
- Libraries like `ethers.js` to recover the signer address from the signature.
- Issue a JWT or secure cookie to manage auth state.

## 🧠 Alternatives (Easier options if you're new to Web3)

- Use **Web3Auth** — provides OAuth + Wallet login via Google, Facebook, etc.

- Use **Magic.link** — simpler and user-friendly, email-based + Web3 support.

## 💡 Recommendation

If your users are **crypto-native**, Web3 login makes sense.

If you're targeting general users, either offer both **email/password** + **wallet login**, or consider using a service like `Clerk`, `Auth0`, or `Firebase` *with* wallet integration.
