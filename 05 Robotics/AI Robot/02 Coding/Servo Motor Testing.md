# Servo Motor testing
## SG 90
- It rotates 360 and continues to rotate like a normal dc motor when the pulse if `625`
![[01 Projects/05 Robotics/AI Robot/Pasted image 20250516142403.png]]
> the rotation starts at `577`

>[!important] Servo Range
>After experiment it is found that the range for this servo is $57 < \text{range} < 577$
