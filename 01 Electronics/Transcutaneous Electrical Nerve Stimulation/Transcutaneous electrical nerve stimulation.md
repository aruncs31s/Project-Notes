+ 20 Nov 
+ Desiging
+ For the prototype we are planning to use [[08 Electronics/Embedded Systems/Micro Controllers/ESP32/ESP32|ESP32]] and ![[TENS Design.excalidraw]] this is the initial design which contains 
- [[09 Projects/Academics/Iot_based_smart_energy_management_system/ESP32/esp32|esp32]] 
- Step up Transformer 
- 2 resistors to devide the voltage and limit current ? 
- [[MOSFET]] to control the transformer
+ 22 Nov 2024
+ New Design 
+ There is an issue with the current design , which is that it is too costly and the, [[08 Electronics/Embedded Systems/Micro Controllers/ESP32/ESP32|ESP32]] is does not really requred here 

+ 22 Nov AN 
+ Purchase 
+ Add something

+ Modules</br>28 Nov 2024
+ Delay Circuit and Inverter 
+ New Version ![[Tens Version 1.excalidraw]] Contains an inverter circuit and a delay control mechanism , it is hard to control the frequency output of the overall circuit or the output of the transformer , instead we can control the power to the inverter circuit using a [[MonoStable Multi-Vibrator]] and use a potentiometer to control its duration and frequency.

+ Verison 0.1.1</br> 5 Dec 2024 
+ First Prototype
